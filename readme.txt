To show the correctness of the backpropagation algorithm, simply run "python3 neuralNetwork.py" in the terminal.
The reason why this occurs is because in my submission I set the variable "run\_benchmarks" in the main method to True, 
and everything else to False. 

If you would like to run other things (e.g., performance metrics and/or error graphs, set the relevant variables in the main method to True). 

To run performance metrics:
Wine Dataset: Set run_wine to True and everything else to False
Vote Dataset: Set run_vote to True and everything else to False

To run error graphs:
Wine Dataset: Set generate_graph_wine to True and everything else to False
Vote Dataset: Set generate_graph_vote to True and everything else to False
